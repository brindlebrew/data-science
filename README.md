# data-science

This is a list of diffrent data sets and files generated while working on learning data science.  Hopefully at some point it becomes a bit more focused as I learn more about Git as well!

Additionally I will start with this in Python and thus will be using PyCharm as a start... this may change as I learn more and become more familiar with diffrent software offerings.
